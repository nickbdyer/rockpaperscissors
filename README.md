Rock, Paper, Scissors
=====================

Week 3 Challenge at Makers Academy
----------------------------------

Your task is to provide a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for them so they can play on the web with the following features:

- [ ] the marketeer has to enter their name before the game
- [ ] the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- [ ] the marketeer can choose one option
- [ ] the game will choose a random option
- [ ] a winner will be declared
- [ ] Bonus 1: Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( yes there are two of them ).
- [ ] Bonus 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard. Use the special rules ( you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock )

Basic Rules
-----------
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock

Methodology
-----------

Contrary to previous projects, rather than start by creating a domain model and CRC cards. Since this is a web application, I am going to build this project from the point of view of the user, such that my Cucumber Features and Scenarios will drive the project development.
